# Torus

## Overview

In Italian, there's a saying: "non tutte le ciambelle riescono col buco" which translates literally to "not all donuts end up with the hole" implying that things don't always turn out as expected. Mathematics has the power to do anything, which is why today, I'll demonstrate the transition of an object from a ring to a sphere.

### Parameters

Let $\mathcal{r}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ denote the major and minor radii, respectively, of various toroidal and spherical objects:

| Object | Inequality |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Ring Torus | $\mathcal{R} > \mathcal{r} > 0$ |
| Horn Torus | $\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{r} > 0$ |
| Spindle Torus | $0 < \mathcal{R} < \mathcal{r}$ |
| Sphere | $\mathcal{R} = 0 < \mathcal{r}$ |
